# Intro

opa-stack is composed of multiple parts, where the most interesting part is the `api`
The api is the heart! See what it is build of [here](/more-info/#what-it-s-made-of)
There are other components as well, but they are mostly just support for the api.

opa-stack isn't just something you deploy and it's ready to use. It's a stack to build your own stuff on, but with it, a lot of batteries. :)

To read more generic info about the project. Like project-goals, see the [more-info](/more-info) page.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is reading some of the guides. They are good examples for different use-cases.
After some skimming through the content, then read more about the api.. Specially the [plugin-system](api/plugin-system), as it will go into more details how it all fits together.
